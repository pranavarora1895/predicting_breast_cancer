# Breast Cancer Detection [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)


**Applying Machine Learning Algorithms (KNeighbors and SVM) to predict the breast cancer (Benign or Malignant).**

> ### KNearest Neighbors

```The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.```

> ### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

```The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.```
